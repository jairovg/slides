## Benefits

* SEO improvements
* Performance benefits

Note:
* SPAs are difficult for search-engine bots to crawl, donâ€™t load the data for the app until after the JavaScript has run in the browser
* No guarantee that any page content that relies on API calls will be run by the crawlers
* In isomorphic apps, the content is rendered by the server
